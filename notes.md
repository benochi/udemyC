# 8 bits per byte decimal to binary

(01010010) = 82

# hexadecimal format starts with 0x

ie: 0x82

MSB / LSB separated into two parts.
8 is MSB, 2 is LSB

we convert this into binary since its 8 bit split in two
8 = 1000
2 = 0010
MSB + LSB = Binary(0b10000010) 0b is used in C to denote binary form
with 16bits, we split into 4 parts, find equivalent binary
IE 0x3A4F
0011, 1010, 0100, 1111
0b0011101001001111
or decimal 14927

IE 0x7B2C
0b0111101100101100
